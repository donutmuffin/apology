I wish I knew what other people were thinking because I spend so much of my time trying to read their minds.</p>
                             Im sry if my overthinking makes me difficult to love. I’m not trying to cause drama where its non existing. I’m only trying to protect my heart.
          
                             <p>I dnt wanna be the person who gets blindsided wen their partner cheats. I dnt wnt to overlook da red flags. I dnt want to be caught off guard. Id rther see the betrayal coming. I would rather know wat is waiting for me down the road.</p>

Tht u are hiding sth frm me. Tht u want nth to do with me.</p>
          
                             <p>I come across as sensitive because I make a big deal out of things that shouldn’t have been given a second thought. U will make a joke that instead of paying it no mind, I will overthink wat da words meant. Simple things u doing will make me think you cant stand me.</p>
